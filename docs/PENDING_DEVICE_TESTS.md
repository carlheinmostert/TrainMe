# Pending Device Tests

Work that has landed on `main` but hasn't been visually verified on Carl's iPhone yet. Batched so Carl installs once and tests many.

## 2026-04-20 checkpoint (current)

**On device:** `fa3efa7` — the offline-first merge. Everything below has landed on main + is in production. Carl is actively QA-ing.

### Recently verified ✅
- Auth loop (password sign-in + magic-link fallback + bad-password fallthrough)
- Portal + mobile UI refactors (clients spine, dashboard R-12, new /network page)
- PayFast sandbox end-to-end (after the passphrase fix)
- Multi-practice switcher on both surfaces
- Pencil-grey line-drawing (final v6 locked)
- "Free credits" vocabulary sweep
- Practice name visibility on mobile
- Leading icon badges on session + client cards
- Session rename wires to `title` (not `clientName`) so the list reflects it

### Open device QA — needs verification round-trip

1. **Offline-first e2e** (`fa3efa7`):
   - Airplane mode → create a client → rename → toggle consent → confirm chip shows "N pending"
   - Airplane mode off → chip drains to hidden → cloud reflects all changes
   - Force-quit + relaunch while offline → cache survives, Home still populated
   - Create a client offline with a name that matches an existing cloud client → `upsert_client_with_id` rewire path kicks in on flush; verify local session refs update

2. **Three-treatment e2e** (vault secret is populated):
   - Capture + publish a new session for a client with `grayscale: true` consent
   - Open plan in mobile preview → B&W tab active → confirm grayscale renders
   - Open same plan in web player → B&W tab active → confirm CSS filter renders
   - Consent-revoke: toggle `grayscale: false` → reload preview → B&W tab disabled with lock

3. **Referral loop e2e**:
   - Create a new account via `/r/{existing-code}` with the POPIA consent checkbox on
   - Make a sandbox purchase
   - Verify in DB: `referral_rebate_ledger` has signup-bonus rows for both sides + lifetime rebate
   - Portal `/network` shows updated stats

4. **Large-plan publish path** — circuits + videos + rests combo, verify the raw-archive cloud upload (step 7.5 in `upload_service.dart`) doesn't regress primary publish on failure.

5. **Studio MediaViewer — treatment cycling + inline consent** (branch `feat/studio-mediaviewer-treatments`):
   - Long-press a Studio thumbnail → "Open full-screen"
   - Verify top-left segmented control renders: Line · B&W · Original
   - Swipe up — cycles Line → B&W → Original → Line with a 220ms crossfade, per-step haptic
   - Swipe down — reverse cycle
   - Tap a segment directly — jumps, same crossfade
   - Active treatment != Line AND client exists → consent chip shows below control ("✓ {Name} can see this" or "Tap to allow")
   - Tap chip → flips state immediately (R-01 no-modal), SyncService queues the write
   - On a pre-archive capture (old session) → B&W + Original segments are greyed out with a lock glyph and tooltip "Older capture — re-record to enable."
   - Horizontal swipe between exercises — page changes, treatment resets to Line (intended)
   - Tap video — play/pause still works
   - Close button returns to Studio

### Things to actively watch for
- **iOS 26.4 SDK gap** — any sub-agent build will fail in their sandbox on this; only Carl's main machine has the SDK installed. Not a code issue.
- **`sessions.client_id` backfill** — runs on every Home load; should be a no-op after first run per practice.
- **Offline pending-ops → online flush timing** — if a rapid sequence of creates+renames goes through while offline, the name-conflict rewire path is the edge case.
